(I figured it’d be helpful to have this)

• Flash roboRIO with software for Java

• Get router set up (though we need the IT guy for this? Or did he already do it? 

• Return inputs from controllers successfully (would it work any differently on mac vs windows in terms of inputs?)

feel free to edit this document with anything you think we need to do in terms of software or w/e (note: you need to keep the spacing present above so that it looks right)
