Basics of Git

Git is repository of our work, and also a way to preserve revision history. It allows us to share what we are working on in a way that has been optimised for coding, and allows us to revert to any previous version if Dave somehow screws it up.

To begin, if you have never used git before, go to https://github.com and create an account. After doing this, ask one of us (currently Joren, Tyler, Matt) to give you permision to access the repository.

In the meantime, there are a few BASH commands that you will need to know to connect to the git repository. These commands are run in the Terminal program that you can find using spotlight or by searching endlessly through your folders like an especially tech-savvy caveman (I have a tendency to do this).once terminal is running, the BASH commands you will need to know are:

cd
This command stands for change directory, and changes what folder your terminal is working inside.

ls
This command stands for list, and lists all the files and directories contained in your current directory (folder).

pwd
This command stands for print working directory, and simply gives the name of the directory your terminal is currently in.

There are some other commands that are useful to know for various other things, but you'll pick them up as you need them. While in the terminal, type simply:
git
If a window pops up suggesting you download X-Code Development Tools, follow the instructions and click the suggested buttons. The dowload should go fairly quickly, but is needed to use git in you r command line.


Once you've been added as a contributor, create a folder somewhere on your computer where you want all the files from the project to go. The way git works is that even though everything is in our online repository, the files are saved locally on your computer, and all your changes remain local until you want to share them or back them up remotely. After you create the folder, navigate to it in the terminal window. Probably the easiest way to do this is to type  cd  into the terminal, and then click and drag your folder into the terminal window. This should copy the file location into the command line, leaving you with something like:
cd /Users/student/Documents/Robotics2015
After which you can hit enter and to make sure it worked, type pwd. It should return the address of your folder (i.e. /Users/student/Documents/Robotics2015).

With your folder ready, you can enter the command:
git clone https://github.com/Team5490/Team5490.git
which will copy the files that have already been created into your folder in a folder called Team5490. If prompted for username, type the username you used for your github account, and likewise for password.
